P2 Program Reflection:


1. Empty Tree Case:
Should always consider what would happen when the tree is empty, especially when you perform remove and get operation, this could cause big problems.

2. Don't try to combine all the methods into one:
I tried to make three of the traversal methods into one big method and have caused some exception errors.

3. Exception handling:
Don't handle the exception locally, instead you should have the calling method handle the exception.
