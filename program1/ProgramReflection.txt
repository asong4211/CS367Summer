P1 Reflection:


1. Throwing Exception
When throw an exception, it should not print the exception, but it should call the super constructor and pass in the error message.

2. Implements an interface
When implements ListADT<E>, the class that implements it should also be generic, don't replace E with Object in the method.

3. Empty case
Should always consider the case when the list is empty, especially for remove or get operation.
